# GRF2071 testboard for lowband
A board for evaluating GRF2071-W Sub-1GHz performance.   
I wanted to see what GRF2071-W can do on SRD860 band and 915MHz band, so I designed a board for it.      
It's mostly based on the GuerillaRF GRF2071 700-1000 MHz appnote (at least initially, had to request S-Parameters).


Not suitable for any purpose.
